The Cards Game Application
=========================
 
This application simulates a card game and its main purpose is to provide the basis for a code review exercise.  

The application contains several intentional issues, some very obvious, others more subtle.

Developers taking this exercise need to implement two steps:

1 - Analyze, find issues and make suggestions to improve the application.  
2 - Fix issues and implement suggestions / improvements.

When analyzing or implementing changes to the applications one should keep in mind the following principles:

- General Software Engineering concepts
- Object Oriented Design principles
- Java Design Patterns
- Code Style / Formatting / Clarity
- Correctness and Validation
